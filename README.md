# findGCO 
`findGCO` is a Perl package for identifying gene conversion events with the next-generation sequencing (NGS) data from the two parents and their progeny in an F1 hybrid population of oubred species. It uses the usual bioinformatics tools such as [bwa](http://bio-bwa.sourceforge.net), [samtools](http://samtools.sourceforge.net) and [picard-tools](http://broadinstitute.github.io/picard) for filtering and mapping reads, phasing haplotypes of parents and genotyping each individual.
# Usage 
After extracting the package file, it is easy to start the process like this, <br>
 ```Perl
 perl findGCO.pl
 ```
However, a text file named [`parameters.txt`](https://github.com/tongchf/findGCO/blob/master/parameters.txt) is needed for setting input parameters, in which some software folders and fastq files are included. It is also include parameters like `THREADS`, `ALPHA`, `MQ`, `BQ` and `GQ`.
